    You're a really great person Love<br>
    
    It has been a fun year can't lie and you're a really great person irrespective of whatever you tell yourself <br>
    Less meetups and way more busy with life but still made time for us here and there<br>
    We'll fix up this year, ma worry, My finalist buddy...teehee<br>
    Been nice getting to watch you grow although now you're reducing literally...God will help you dw<br>
    You'd deny it but you're better than you were a year ago and I'm proud of you for that<br>
    Despite all I say and do, I genuinely do care for you and wish you nothing but the best honestly<br>
    Grateful for the banter and the jokes and the bickering <br>
    Anyways this is getting long and you're a busy girl...It's your day<br>
    
    What I'm trying to say is you're an amazing person and you deserve nothing but the best in this life and I wish nothing else for you besides that and glad to see surely but slowly you're getting there<br>
    And I'll keep on trying to help you achieve it anyway humanely and inhumanity possible(You already know)🤭<br>
    So glad Olamide added me to that group and we eventually found ourselves<br>
    And besides all I say, My love, you are part of my top 2 choices and it isn't 2🙂‍↔️<br>
    Plus my letter of then is true...love for you like a circle(Endless...tueh)

    Allah will make it easy<br>
    This would be the Sixth year in a row I'm wishing you <br>
